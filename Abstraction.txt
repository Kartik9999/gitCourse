EMPLOYER CLASS  - data members like id of employee, age of employee,
name of employee, gross salary of employee.

We will also create a method which will calculate the NET SALARY. If 

GROSS SALARY <= 400000- 10 percent income tax

GROSS SALARY > 400000 and <= 1000000 - 20 percent income tax

GROSS SALARY > 1000000 and <= 1500000 - 25 percent income tax

GROSS SALARY > 1500000  - 30 percent income tax

Employyee needs to see their net salasry
